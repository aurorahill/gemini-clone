# Gemini Chatbot

## Simpler version of Gemini chatbot

### Write your question in the input and send it to the chatbot. You can also change the display mode to light/dark and delete the chat using the buttons. Your chat and light mode will be saved in localstorage until your next visit. Have fun!

### If you want to use this repository locally you need to get your api_key from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey and paste it in the index.js file in the API_KEY variable (e.g. const API_KEY = 'your-api_key';)
